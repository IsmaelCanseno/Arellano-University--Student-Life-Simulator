LORE BOOK #1


In the year 502B.C a small crusade of warriors set to the stars, destination unknown and fueled by rage blood these warriors wanted a glorious fight that had never been fought before them, to impress the god kings of old they constructed grand machines that belted fire from beneath and shot them across the heavens like a heroes arrow. As the warriors traveled the heavens surviving on scraps and even sometimes consuming the fallen they came upon something new, something magnificent, a mighty ship decorated in strange metals and large statues at the helm, this fueled the warriors as they got closer, the rage blood that had been lying dormant durning their travels had begun to burn again for this was the battle they belived would seal their fate and the awesome army that would shed their blood across the stars.


Now, in the year 20XX most have forgotten about the legends of old, warrior tales of valiant battles, the current known world is not so known any longer, desimated by constant wars has left nearly all of the globe as a desert badlands filled with ancient ruins and dangers that have yet to be seen for more than a thousand years. Now the world is run by small academys, these academys act as small nations onto themselfs usually battling with other academys for pride or simple dominance.


Conclusion of the Battle : 

Ideas : 
Maybe the warriors win and are simply not compatible with this new ships "metal" they began to break the ship down and carry it on board their own ship, but after time the metal begins to have odd effects on them and even fusing with them for some unknown reason, maybe something to do with their already genetic rage blood. thus resulting in the creation of "rage metal"

These ancient warriors invented a new substance they called rage metal, this metal could form to the body as many different things but the most common were armor & weapons. If they were not careful and lost full control of there senses the metal could consume the entire body and swallow them whole,thus forming them into what legend refers to as hyper forms.
